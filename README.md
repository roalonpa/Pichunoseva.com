## üíô What is it about?

**PICHUNOSEVA.COM** is a website made with jokes, photos, memories and mini games made for Pia, our CS teacher. She wants to retire next year, so if she does, this page is to remind her that we will not forget her. But the real goal is to convince her to stay.

## ‚ú® The site

### üéÆ Fun Interactive Stuff
- **Choose Your Own Adventure Game** - You can play through different scenarios and see what happens if Pichu retires vs. if she stays (spoiler: staying is always the better choice)
- **Our Timeline Together** - All the memories from when we first met her until now. 
- **The Blackout Story** - Cami wrote this amazing story about how we wouldn't be able to survive without Pichu.

### üéµ Music & Photos  
- **Our Song for Pichu** - We literally made a song called "Don't go, Pichu" (yes, we're that desperate)
- **Trip Photos** - Edited photos of us in a cruise, as we obviously didn't go to one.
- **Spotify Playlist** - All the songs that remind us of Pichu

### üíª Related with CS
- **Python Code** - Code that shows how Pichu retiring would break everything 
- **Bug Tracker** - Like the ones real programmers use, but it has "Pichu's retirement" as CRITICAL. It includes many mistakes that everyone keeps doing.
- **Mobile responsive** - I added responsive CSS so that the page can be seen from any device.

## üõ†Ô∏è How I built it
- **React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page apps.
- **CSS** - The language used to style and layout web pages.
- **GSAP animations** - A powerful JavaScript library for creating smooth, complex animations on the web.

## üé® Other Features

- Moving background animation
- Works perfectly on phones, tablets, etc
- Interactive designs
- Pichu's song plays and confetti explodes if she chooses to stay
